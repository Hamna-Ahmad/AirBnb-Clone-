## App Structure
The app consists of the following files and directories:

- App.jsx: The main component that renders the header and location components based on the data provided.
- components/Header.jsx: Renders the header section of the app, displaying the logo and the title.
- components/Location.jsx: Renders a single location, including the image, location information, dates, and description.

## Usage
### App.jsx
The App.jsx file is the entry point of the application. It imports the necessary components and data, maps over the location data to create Location components, and renders the header and location sections.

### Header.jsx
The Header.jsx component renders the header section of the app. It displays the logo and the title "My Travel Journal."

### Location.jsx
The Location.jsx component renders a single location entry. It displays the location image, location information, dates of visit, and a description. It also includes a link to view the location on Google Maps.

## Customization
You can customize the app by modifying the following:

- Logo: Replace the logo.png file in the /src directory with your own logo.
- Styling: Customize the CSS in the App.css file to change the look and feel of the app.

## Data
The app uses a separate data.js file to store the location information. You can modify the data in that file to add, remove, or edit locations. Each location entry should have the following properties:

- id: A unique identifier for the location.
- imageUrl: The URL of the location image.
- location: The name of the location.
- googleMapsUrl: The URL to view the location on Google Maps.
- title: The title of the location entry.
